This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

added node input hook
changed again....

can we provide extra options to the invoking command through hooks
What happens if a workflow already present in repo which is configured to execute on push but no runs present for it yet
Do a git pull at the end of pre-push hook (before it completing)





1. Workflow being triggered if no old workflow exists.
2. if new exists then cancel workflow. Now the second issue above (YAML Parsing)
3. Show the information regarding the new workflow to the user so that they can have a look at the run.
4. We have got a workaround for the Remote repo and the local repo not being in sync, but that might not be the most preferred solution, so I have to explore one or two things around that.
5. So once we are sure about that the workflow being done is what is required we can work on the azure login and once that is solved, we can use those credentials to use available resources and call an API to deploy to azure..



1. "git push origin master" and pre-push hook has git pull in the end : SAME ERROR
